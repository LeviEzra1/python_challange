# python_challange

This module was definilty a team effort. Useing some code from those who are far more knowligeable 
I wish that I could get a fermer grasp on the codeing but luckly i had my proffesors, classmates, father, and for good mesure a tuter that helped me to 
better understand what each line of code did.
I am aware that to succseed in this class I will need to devote more time to study and the baiscs if it were not for the Xpert lerning asssistent 
I dont belive i could write all this code
all this to say thank goodness its over and on to pandas
